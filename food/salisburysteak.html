        <p>This Salisbury steak recipe comes together quickly and does not need a lot of time in the slow cooker. It's a delicious way to add flavor to ground beef and the children love it! The gravy is delightful served over mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 envelope dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cans of condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 packet dry au jus mix</li>

        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, milk, and onion soup mix together in a large bowl until well combined; shape into 8 patties.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge patties in flour just to coat, and quickly brown on both sides in the hot skillet. Place browned patties into the slow cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid.</li>
            <li>Mix condensed soup, water, and au jus mix together in a medium bowl; pour over the beef patties. Cook on Low until ground beef is well done, about 4 to 5 hours.</li>
